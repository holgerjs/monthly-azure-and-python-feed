- The [Microsoft Developer YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MicrosoftDeveloper) [26] has a recording of an [Introduction to Language Models and Applications of Azure OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-dETevTkm4) [27].
    > This live session will introduce Azure OpenAI, discuss the different language models available, and demonstrate how these models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Presenters will demonstrate how users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.
