### Updates

- In a blogpost about the [State of the Azure SDK 2023](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/state-of-the-azure-sdk-2023/) [24], the Azure SDK team has announced the launch of a monthly Azure SDK Community Standup.
    > [The SDK Team's] goal is to create a space where developers can come together, share their experiences and knowledge, and discuss the latest developments in the Azure SDK ecosystem. [...] Join us every second Tuesday of the month from 11:00 AM to noon Pacific Time (UTC-8) to learn, collaborate, and grow with the community. Check out the recording of our premiere standup!
    - The [first recording is here](https://www.youtube.com/live/HizG8gMR9WI?feature=share). [25]

- New Python versions have been released.
    - [Python 3.10.10](https://docs.python.org/release/3.10.10/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-10-10-final) [22] and [Python 3.11.2](https://docs.python.org/release/3.11.2/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-11-2) [23]

- [Azure Functions support for Python 3.10](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/generally-available-azure-functions-support-for-python-310/) is GA. [21]
    > You can now develop functions using Python 3.10 locally and deploy them to all Azure Functions plans.

- [Developing Azure Functions using the v2 programming model for Python | Azure Friday](https://youtu.be/KARieaWBxuk) [19]
    > Gavin Aguiar and Shreya Batra join Scott Hanselman to discuss the v2 programming model for Azure Functions using Python.
    - Comprehensive overview over the simplified v2 programming model and how quick deployments can be done through Visual Studio Code.

- Announcements of [the latest beta release of the Azure Text Analytics client libraries for Python](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/announcing-the-new-beta-release-of-azure-text-analytics-libraries/) [18]. The blog post highlights Python samples for these features:
    - Abstractive summarization
    - Named entity recognition (NER) resolutions
    - Dynamic classification
    - Healthcare FHIR bundles with document type
    - Automatic language and script detection

    
    > **Note**
    >
    > If you follow the example along:
    > - you may need to create the cognitive services account in the right region, otherwise you might be seein errors like this when attempting to run the code: `{'code': 'InvalidRequest', 'message': "Job task: 'AbstractiveSummarization-0' failed with validation error: Document abstractive summarization is not supported in the region {Your-Region}. The supported regions are North Europe, East US, UK South."}`
    > - you may need to request access at https://aka.ms/applyforgatedsummarizationfeatures if the service is part of a gated public preview feature.
